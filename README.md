The files for this project are stored in the `AD-report` directory

## Below are the the specific files for this project and the assessment they represent.

`number-of-file-folder.py file executes assessment 1`

`number-of-child-objects.py executes assessment 2`

`nested-file-folder-sf-df.py executes assessment 3`

## I have narrated below  where the necessary reports for all the files for the assessment are stored:

The printed report for number-of-file-folder.py is stored in `report-for-number-of-file-folder.py`
The printed report fornumber-of-child-objects.py is stored in `report-number-of-child-objects.py.py`
The result for the nested-file-folder-sf-df.py is stored in the `destination folder` of my google drive and I will be sharing the link to the email address provided in the instruction of the assessment.

## NOTE: 
For security reasons; before pushing the code, I removed the `token` for the service account that was supposed be stored in `service-account.json` file.
